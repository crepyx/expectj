Introduction   

     Thank you for downloading this release of     ExpectJ 1.1.
     ExpectJ is a ready to use java version of Unix expect utility.
     Note: hands on knowledge of Unix expect is a prerequisite

     Words from the wise:
     The API is very easy to use, initially you might get little confused
     but soon you will get used to the confusion.


Installation    

     Unzip the downloaded file. I guess you have already done it, other wise 
     you would not be reading this README.txt. 
     You just need to put $EXTRACT_DIR/classes.jar file 
     in your class path and you are ready to write code accessing 
     the ExpectJ API.
     For more information on how to use it, refer to User Documentation. 

New features

  	 On public demand, I have introduced a new method to get the standard 
	 out and standard err contents from the spawned process. I have also fixed
	 some corner case bugs.

        
Features expected in future releases
     
     Need to go through the Expect man page; I know there are plenty 
     to implement, let me know when you want a particular feature 
     though I don't guarantee that I will oblige.
